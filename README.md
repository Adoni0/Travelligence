Computer Vision

Microsoft Computer Vision analyzes the users uploaded images and extracts meta information about the image. We use this information to place the image into a category (outdoor_city, outdoor_scenic, food, animal, etc.) in which a group of countries will share.  This is an important aspect of our algorithm to narrow down your place of travel.
